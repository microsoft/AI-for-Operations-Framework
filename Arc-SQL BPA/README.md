<h3>Azure SQL BPA OpenAI integration: Configuration</h3>
 
| **Parameters/Requirements** | **Information** | **Note** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Azure OpenAI Model | This solution require specific Azure OpenAI Model | Version gpt-4-1106-preview  |
| replacewithsubid | Connection setting during deployment | Replace with your Subscription ID |
| replacewithRG | Connection setting during deployment | Replace with the selected RG Name for the deployment |
| replace with tenant id | HTTP Module: Tenant ID | Replace with your Tenant ID |
| OpenAI API Key | String Resource to connect to OpenAI | Replace with your Azure OpenAI Key |


<h3> Important </h3>
 This LogApp and the following changes are an example of integrating SQL BPA results with OpenAI, creating an HTML report and CSV file send via Email with OpenAI comment of Severity High and/or Medium results. 
 You can customize them to your liking such as changing the query and/or question to  ChatGPT as well as sending the results not only via email but also to Ondrive or Storage Account for example.
 Before using it you must have enabled and performed SQL Best Practices Assessment on your hybrid Machine.

<h3>Deploy</h3>

When you deploy, replace with your SubscriptionID and ResourceGroup Name:

![iDeploy](./images/deploy.jpg)


<h3>Required Identity</h3>
<h4>Managed Identity</h4>

When the deployment is completed go in your Logic App and create a Managed Identity following the example below and give them __LogAnalytics Reader__ permission:

![identity](./images/identity.jpg)

<h3>Logic App Workflow Setting</h3>
<h4>High throughput </h4>

Set High throughput to ON:

![identity](./images/HighThroughput.jpg)

<h3> Deployment and Result </h3>
 
After deployment completed, please follow the documentation:


Change __Recurrence__ section after SQL BPA has been performed:

![recurrence](./images/recurrence.jpg)

Change the broken module __Run query and list result__ with a new one
 
Before: <br>
![Run query and list result](./images/run-query-list-result1.jpg)

After: <br>
![Run query and list result](./images/run-query-list-result2.jpg)

Compile all the information following your configuration.<br>
For the query field past the code below:

```query
let selectedCategories = dynamic([]);
let selectedTotSev = dynamic([]);
SqlAssessment_CL
| extend asmt = parse_csv(RawData)
//| where asmt[11] =~ "MSSQLSERVER" 
| extend
    AsmtId=tostring(asmt[1]),
    CheckId=tostring(asmt[2]),
    DisplayString=asmt[3],
    Description=tostring(asmt[4]),
    HelpLink=asmt[5],
    TargetType=case(asmt[6] == 1, "Server", asmt[6] == 2, "Database", ""),
    TargetName=tostring(asmt[7]), 
    Severity=case(asmt[8] == 30, "High", asmt[8] == 20, "Medium", asmt[8] == 10, "Low", asmt[8] == 0, "Information", asmt[8] == 1, "Warning", asmt[8] == 2, "Critical", "Passed"),

    and (set_has_element(dynamic(['*']), CheckId) or "'*'" == "'*'")
    and (set_has_element(dynamic(['*']), TargetName) or "'*'" == "'*'")
    and set_has_element(dynamic([30, 20, 10, 0]), Sev)
    and (array_length(set_intersect(TagsArr, dynamic(['*']))) > 0 or "'*'" == "'*'")
    and (CheckId == '''' and Sev == 0 or "''" == "''")
| extend Category = case(
                        array_length(set_intersect(TagsArr, dynamic(["CPU", "IO", "Storage"]))) > 0,
                        '0',
                        array_length(set_intersect(TagsArr, dynamic(["TraceFlag", "Backup", "DBCC", "DBConfiguration", "SystemHealth", "Traces", "DBFileConfiguration", "Configuration", "Replication", "Agent", "Security", "DataIntegrity", "MaxDOP", "PageFile", "Memory", "Performance", "Statistics"]))) > 0,
                        '1',
                        array_length(set_intersect(TagsArr, dynamic(["UpdateIssues", "Index", "Naming", "Deprecated", "masterDB", "QueryOptimizer", "QueryStore", "Indexes"]))) > 0,
                        '2',
                        '3'
                    )
| where (Sev >= 0 and array_length(selectedTotSev) == 0 or Sev in (selectedTotSev))
    and (Category in (selectedCategories) or array_length(selectedCategories) == 0)
| project
    TargetType,
    TargetName,
    Severity,
    Message,
    Tags=strcat_array(array_slice(TagsArr, 1, -1), ', '),
    CheckId,
    Description,
    HelpLink = tostring(HelpLink),
    SeverityCode = toint(Sev)
| order by SeverityCode desc, TargetType desc, TargetName asc
| project-away SeverityCode 
```

Configure the Api Key with the value inside your OpenAI Service:

![Sentinel Api Key](./images/ApiKey.jpg)

Configure __ForeachSQLResult__ section with value of query result and each parameter in Question variable as you like:

![SQL BPA question](./images/query-value.jpg)
![SQL BPA question](./images/value-question.jpg)

Configure the severity level as a condition filter as you prefer:

![SQL BPA question](./images/severity.jpg)

Now configure the HTTP Connector for OpenAI Connection following this configuration:

![Sentinel HTTP Connector](./images/http-connector.jpg)

At this point, be sure that the ComposeCSV block is correctly configured. When the "Run query and list result" block is recreated some link can be resetted. Follow the ComposeCSV attribute configuration following the example below (if the new UI model is not useful for the customization, evaluate to switch in "code view" mode):

![ComposeCSV](./images/composeCSV.jpeg)

The last configuration is change the broken module __Send an email (V2)__ with a new one, add the attachment and customize the file name :

Before <br>
![Sentinel Add Content](./images/sendEmail-broken.jpg)

After <br>
![Sentinel Add Content](./images/send-email2.jpg)

Now save your LogicApp and __Enable__ it.
