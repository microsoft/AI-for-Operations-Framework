This repository is the accompanying code for the "AI-based T-SQL Refactoring: an automatic intelligent code optimization with Azure OpenAI" article. Make sure that check that out.

# SQLAIRefactor

**SQLAIRefactor** is a Windows Forms application that leverages Azure OpenAI to analyze and optimize T-SQL queries. It connects to your SQL Server database, extracts schema metadata in JSON format, and uses prompt engineering and large language models to refactor queries and apply SQL Server best practices automatically.
